<h2>Jobs</h2>

<p>
    I, and other team leaders in my research group, are frequently looking for postdocs, phd students, as well as
    student assistants, with background in
    e.g. mathematics, computer sciences, bioinformatics or machine learning.
    We always have a variety of open problems related to method development, modeling, benchmarking and evaluation,
    software engineering, and applications to problems in biology.
